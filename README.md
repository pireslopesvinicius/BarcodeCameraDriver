# Barcode Camera Driver

It's a "driver" for your desktop camera that makes possible to simulate a barcode scanner, it takes pictures from the camera and identify the barcodes in it, then type it like a scanner would do and simulate a "press enter" in the end, the expected behaviour of a barcode scanner.

## Features
- Simulates a barcode scanner.
- Detects barcodes in real-time by taking pictures from the camera and analysing it.
- Types the barcode and presses "Enter" automatically.
